# graphene-conductive-ink
We developed an eco-friendly conductive ink using waste oil, polystyrene, and graphene. Longer-milled graphene improved conductivity, while polystyrene enhanced film formation. The best mix used bay oil, polystyrene (0.5:1), and ball-milled graphene, offering a sustainable ink alternative.
